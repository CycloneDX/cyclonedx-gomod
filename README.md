*cyclonedx-gomod* creates CycloneDX Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) from Go modules

## Installation

Prebuilt binaries are available on the [releases](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-gomod/releases) page.

### From Source

```shell
go install github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-gomod@v0.8.2
```

> This project is not in a stable state yet and may be subject to breaking changes.  
> When using it in CI/CD pipelines, we recommend pinning its version instead of using `@latest`,
> as shown in the command above.

Building from source requires Go 1.16 or newer.

## Compatibility

*cyclonedx-gomod* will produce BOMs for the latest version of the CycloneDX specification 
[supported by cyclonedx-go](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-go#compatibility), which currently is [1.2](https://cyclonedx.org/docs/1.2/).  
You can use the [CycloneDX CLI](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-cli#convert-command) to convert between multiple 
BOM formats or specification versions. 

## Accuracy

Currently, SBOMs generated with *cyclonedx-gomod* include all modules that are required by the respective main module. 
Technically speaking, you can call `go mod why -m -vendor` with any module in the SBOM, and you will get a non-empty 
list of packages that use that module. We're working towards providing a higher accuracy for [specific use-cases](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-gomod/issues/20#issuecomment-847163027).

## Usage

```
Usage of cyclonedx-gomod:
  -json
        Output in JSON format
  -licenses
        Resolve module licenses
  -module string
        Path to Go module (default ".")
  -noserial
        Omit serial number
  -novprefix
        Omit "v" version prefix
  -output string
        Output path (default "-")
  -reproducible
        Make the SBOM reproducible by omitting dynamic content
  -serial string
        Serial number (default [random UUID])
  -std
        Include Go standard library as component and dependency of the module
  -test
        Include test dependencies
  -type string
        Type of the main component (default "application")
  -version
        Show version
```

> *cyclonedx-gomod* honors the `GONOPROXY` and `GOPRIVATE` environment variables and 
> won't reach out to external data sources for private modules (e.g. for [license resolution](#licenses)).

### Example

```shell
$ cyclonedx-gomod -licenses -std -output bom.xml
```

Checkout the [`examples`](./examples) directory for examples of BOMs generated by *cyclonedx-gomod*.

### Docker

```shell
$ docker run -it --rm \
    -v "$GOPATH/pkg/mod:/go/pkg/mod" \
    -v "/path/to/mymodule:/mymodule" \
    -v "$(pwd):/out" \
    cyclonedx/cyclonedx-gomod -module /mymodule -output /out/bom.xml -licenses
```

Note how the host's module cache (`$GOPATH/pkg/mod`) is mounted into the container to avoid re-downloading modules. This is optional.

### Vendoring

Modules that use [vendoring](https://golang.org/ref/mod#go-mod-vendor) are, although in a limited manner, supported.  
Limitations are as follows:

* **No hashes.** Go doesn't copy all module files to `vendor`, only those that are required to build
  and test the main module. Because [module checksums](#hashes) consider almost all files in a module's directory though, 
  calculating accurate hashes from the `vendor` directory is not possible. As a consequence, BOMs for modules that use
  vendoring do not include component hashes.

### Licenses

There is currently no standard way for developers to declare their module's license.  
Detecting licenses based on files in a repository is a non-trivial task, which is why *cyclonedx-gomod*  
uses [`pkg.go.dev`](https://pkg.go.dev/) to resolve module licenses (please read their [license disclaimer](https://pkg.go.dev/license-policy)).

While `pkg.go.dev`'s license matching *may* be accurate most of the time, BOMs should state facts.  
This is why license resolution is an opt-in feature (using the `-licenses` flag). If you are a vendor and legally
required to provide 100% accurate BOMs, **do not** use this feature.

### Hashes

*cyclonedx-gomod* uses the same hashing algorithm Go uses for its [module authentication](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/25530-sumdb.md#module-authentication-with).  
[`vikyd/go-checksum`](https://github.com/vikyd/go-checksum#calc-checksum-of-module-directory) does a great job of
explaining what exactly that entails. In essence, the hash you see in a BOM should be the same as in your `go.sum` file,
just in a different format. This is because the CycloneDX specification enforces hashes to be provided in hex encoding,
while Go uses base64 encoded values.

To verify a hash found in a BOM, do the following:

1. Hex decode the value
2. Base64 encode the value
3. Prefix the value with `h1:`
4. Compare with the expected module checksum

#### Example

Given the following `component` element in a BOM:

```xml
<component bom-ref="pkg:golang/github.com/google/uuid@v1.2.0" type="library">
  <name>github.com/google/uuid</name>
  <version>v1.2.0</version>
  <scope>required</scope>
  <hashes>
    <hash alg="SHA-256">
      a8962d5e72515a6a5eee6ff75e5ca1aec2eb11446a1d1336931ce8c57ab2503b
    </hash>
  </hashes>
  <licenses>
    <license>
      <id>BSD-3-Clause</id>
      <url>https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html</url>
    </license>
  </licenses>
  <purl>pkg:golang/github.com/google/uuid@v1.2.0</purl>
  <externalReferences>
    <reference type="vcs">
      <url>https://github.com/google/uuid</url>
    </reference>
  </externalReferences>
</component>
```

We take the hash, hex decode it, base64 encode the resulting bytes and prefix that with `h1:` (demonstrated [here](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Hex('Auto')To_Base64('A-Za-z0-9%2B/%3D')Pad_lines('Start',3,'h1:')&input=YTg5NjJkNWU3MjUxNWE2YTVlZWU2ZmY3NWU1Y2ExYWVjMmViMTE0NDZhMWQxMzM2OTMxY2U4YzU3YWIyNTAzYg) in a CyberChef recipe).

In this case, we end up with `h1:qJYtXnJRWmpe7m/3XlyhrsLrEURqHRM2kxzoxXqyUDs=`.  
In order to verify that this matches what we expect, we can query Go's [checksum database](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/25530-sumdb.md#checksum-database) for the component we're inspecting:

```
$ curl https://sum.golang.org/lookup/github.com/google/uuid@v1.2.0
2580307
github.com/google/uuid v1.2.0 h1:qJYtXnJRWmpe7m/3XlyhrsLrEURqHRM2kxzoxXqyUDs=
github.com/google/uuid v1.2.0/go.mod h1:TIyPZe4MgqvfeYDBFedMoGGpEw/LqOeaOT+nhxU+yHo=

go.sum database tree
3935567
SapHtgdNCeF00Cx8kqztePV24kgzNg++Xovae42HAMw=

â€” sum.golang.org Az3grsm7Wm4CVNR1RHq9BFnu9jzcRlU2uw7lr0gfUWgO6+rqPNjT+fUTl9gH0NRTgdwW9nItuQSMbhSaLCsk8YeYSAs=
```

Line 2 of the response tells us that the checksum in our BOM matches that known to the checksum database.

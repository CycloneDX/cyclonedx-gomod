*cyclonedx-gomod* creates CycloneDX Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) from Go modules

## Installation

Prebuilt binaries are available on the [releases](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-gomod/releases) page.

### From Source

```shell
go install github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-gomod/cmd/cyclonedx-gomod@latest
```

Building from source requires Go 1.17 or newer.

## Compatibility

*cyclonedx-gomod* aims to produce SBOMs according to the latest CycloneDX specification, which currently is [1.3](https://cyclonedx.org/docs/1.3/). 
You can use the [CycloneDX CLI](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-cli#convert-command) to convert between multiple BOM formats or specification versions. 

## Usage

```
USAGE
  cyclonedx-gomod <SUBCOMMAND> [FLAGS...] [<ARG>...]

cyclonedx-gomod creates CycloneDX Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) from Go modules.

Multiple subcommands are offered, each targeting different use cases:

- SBOMs generated with "app" include only those modules that the target application
  actually depends on. Modules required by tests or packages that are not imported
  by the application are not included. Build constraints are evaluated, which enables
  a very detailed view of what's really compiled into an application's binary.
  
- SBOMs generated with "mod" include the aggregate of modules required by all 
  packages in the target module. This optionally includes modules required by
  tests and test packages. Build constraints are NOT evaluated, allowing for 
  a "whole picture" view on the target module's dependencies.

- "bin" offers support of generating rudimentary SBOMs from binaries built with Go modules.

Distributors of applications will typically use "app" and provide the resulting SBOMs
alongside their application's binaries. This enables users to only consume SBOMs for
artifacts that they actually use. For example, a Go module may include "server" and
"client" applications, of which only the "client" is distributed to users. 
Additionally, modules included in "client" may differ, depending on which platform 
it was compiled for.

Vendors or maintainers may choose to use "mod" for internal use, where it's too
cumbersome to deal with many SBOMs for the same product. Possible use cases are: 
- Tracking of component inventory
- Tracking of third party component licenses
- Continuous monitoring for vulnerabilities
"mod" may also be used to generate SBOMs for libraries.

SUBCOMMANDS
  app      Generate SBOMs for applications
  bin      Generate SBOMs for binaries
  mod      Generate SBOMs for modules
  version  Show version information
```

### Subcommands

#### `app`

```
USAGE
  cyclonedx-gomod app [FLAGS...] [MODULE_PATH]

Generate SBOMs for applications.

In order to produce accurate SBOMs, build constraints must be configured
via environment variables. These build constraints should mimic the ones passed
to the "go build" command for the application.

Environment variables that act as build constraints are:
  - GOARCH       The target architecture (386, amd64, etc.)
  - GOOS         The target operating system (linux, windows, etc.)
  - CGO_ENABLED  Whether or not CGO is enabled
  - GOFLAGS      Flags that are passed to the Go command (e.g. build tags)

A complete overview of all environment variables can be found here:
  https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Environment_variables

Applicable build constraints are included as properties of the main component.

Because build constraints influence Go's module selection, an SBOM should be generated
for each target in the build matrix.

The -main flag should be used to specify the path to the application's main package.
It must point to a directory within MODULE_PATH. If not set, MODULE_PATH is assumed.

In order to not only include modules, but also the packages within them,
the -packages flag can be used. Packages are represented as subcomponents of modules.

By passing -files, all files that would be included in a binary will be attached
as subcomponents of their respective package. File versions follow the v0.0.0-SHORTHASH pattern, 
where SHORTHASH is the first 12 characters of the file's SHA1 hash.
Because files are subcomponents of packages, -files can only be used in conjunction with -packages.

Examples:
  $ GOARCH=arm64 GOOS=linux GOFLAGS="-tags=foo,bar" cyclonedx-gomod app -output linux-arm64.bom.xml
  $ cyclonedx-gomod app -json -output acme-app.bom.json -files -licenses -main cmd/acme-app /usr/src/acme-module

FLAGS
  -assert-licenses=false  Assert detected licenses
  -files=false            Include files
  -json=false             Output in JSON
  -licenses=false         Perform license detection
  -main ...               Path to the application's main package, relative to MODULE_PATH
  -noserial=false         Omit serial number
  -output -               Output file path (or - for STDOUT)
  -packages=false         Include packages
  -serial ...             Serial number
  -std=false              Include Go standard library as component and dependency of the module
  -verbose=false          Enable verbose output
```

#### `bin`

```
USAGE
  cyclonedx-gomod bin [FLAGS...] BINARY_PATH

Generate SBOMs for binaries.

Although the binary is never executed, it must be executable.
This is a requirement by the "go version -m" command that is used to provide this functionality.

When license detection is enabled, all modules (including the main module) 
will be downloaded to the module cache using "go mod download".
For the download of the main module to work, its version has to be provided
via the -version flag.

Please note that data embedded in binaries shouldn't be trusted,
unless there's solid evidence that the binaries haven't been modified
since they've been built.

Example:
  $ cyclonedx-gomod bin -json -output acme-app-v1.0.0.bom.json -version v1.0.0 ./acme-app

FLAGS
  -assert-licenses=false  Assert detected licenses
  -json=false             Output in JSON
  -licenses=false         Perform license detection
  -noserial=false         Omit serial number
  -output -               Output file path (or - for STDOUT)
  -serial ...             Serial number
  -std=false              Include Go standard library as component and dependency of the module
  -verbose=false          Enable verbose output
  -version ...            Version of the main component
```

#### `mod`

```
USAGE
  cyclonedx-gomod mod [FLAGS...] [MODULE_PATH]

Generate SBOMs for modules.

Examples:
  $ cyclonedx-gomod mod -licenses -type library -json -output bom.json ./cyclonedx-go
  $ cyclonedx-gomod mod -test -output bom.xml ./cyclonedx-go

FLAGS
  -assert-licenses=false  Assert detected licenses
  -json=false             Output in JSON
  -licenses=false         Perform license detection
  -noserial=false         Omit serial number
  -output -               Output file path (or - for STDOUT)
  -serial ...             Serial number
  -std=false              Include Go standard library as component and dependency of the module
  -test=false             Include test dependencies
  -type application       Type of the main component
  -verbose=false          Enable verbose output
```

### Examples 📃

In order to demonstrate what SBOMs generated with *cyclonedx-gomod* look like, 
as well as to give you an idea about the differences between the commands `app`, 
`mod` and `bin`, we provide example SBOMs for each command in the [`examples`](./examples) directory.

The whole process of generating these examples is encapsulated in [`Dockerfile.examples`](./Dockerfile.examples).  
To generate them yourself, simply execute the following command:

```shell
$ GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 make examples-image examples
```

### GitHub Actions 🤖

We made a GitHub Action to help integrate *cyclonedx-gomod* into existing CI/CD workflows!  
You can find it on the GitHub marketplace: [*gh-gomod-generate-sbom*](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cyclonedx-gomod-generate-sbom)

### GoReleaser 🚀

The recommended way of integrating with [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) is via `post` [build hook](https://goreleaser.com/customization/build/#build-hooks):

```yaml
builds:
  - env:
      - CGO_ENABLED=0
    goos:
      - linux
      - windows
      - darwin
    goarch:
      - amd64
      - arm64
    tags:
      - foo
      - bar
    hooks:
      post:
        # Generate an SBOM for every build in the build matrix
        - cmd: cyclonedx-gomod app -licenses -json -output "{{ .ProjectName }}_{{ .Version }}_{{ .Target }}.bom.json"
          # Target architecture and OS, as well as build tags have to be provided
          # via environment variables. Architecture and OS are available as template
          # variables, but tags have to be hardcoded.
          # CGO_ENABLED is inherited from the env node above in this example.
          env:
            - GOARCH={{ .Arch }}
            - GOOS={{ .Os }}
            - GOFLAGS="-tags=foo,bar"

release:
  # Attach SBOMs to GitHub release
  extra_files:
    - glob: ./*.bom.json
```

When generating SBOMs during a GoReleaser execution, it's important to `gitignore` these files.
Otherwise, GoReleaser will complain about the state of the repo being dirty.
Given the naming scheme above, the following `.gitignore` line does the job:

```
*.bom.json
```

### Docker 🐳

```shell
$ docker run -it --rm \
    -v "/path/to/mymodule:/usr/src/mymodule" \
    -v "$(pwd):/out" \
    cyclonedx/cyclonedx-gomod:v1 mod -json -output /out/bom.json /usr/src/mymodule
```

> The image is based on `golang:1.17-alpine`.  
> When using the `app` command, please keep in mind that the Go version may influence module selection.  
> We generally recommend using a [precompiled binary](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-gomod/releases) 
> and running it in the same environment in which you're building your application in.

### Library Usage

Starting with `v1.2.0`, *cyclonedx-gomod* can be used as a library as well:

```shell
go get -v github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-gomod
```

Refer to the [documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-gomod) for details and examples.

> Be warned that *cyclonedx-gomod* is and will continue to be primarily a CLI tool.  
> While we'll only introduce breaking changes to the exposed APIs in accordance with semver,
> we will not invest in supporting older versions. If you intend on depending on our API,
> please assess if you'll be able to keep up. For example, we will move to the newest Go version
> shortly after its GA, and will almost definitely use backwards-incompatible features going forward.

## Important Notes

### Vendoring

Modules that use [vendoring](https://golang.org/ref/mod#go-mod-vendor) are, although in a limited manner, supported.  
Limitations are as follows:

* **No hashes.** Go doesn't copy all module files to `vendor`, only those that are required to build
  and test the main module. Because [module checksums](#hashes) consider almost all files in a module's directory though, 
  calculating accurate hashes from the `vendor` directory is not possible. As a consequence, SBOMs for modules that use
  vendoring do not include component hashes.
* **License detection may fail.** Go doesn't always copy license files when vendoring modules, which may cause license detection to fail.

### Licenses

There is currently no standard way for developers to declare their module's license.  
Detecting licenses based on files in a repository is a non-trivial task, which is why *cyclonedx-gomod*  
uses [`go-license-detector`](https://github.com/go-enry/go-license-detector) to resolve module licenses.

While `go-license-detector`'s license matching *may* be accurate most of the time, SBOMs should state facts.  
This is why detected licenses are included as [evidences](https://cyclonedx.org/news/cyclonedx-v1.3-released/#copyright-and-license-evidence), 
rather than the `licenses` field directly.

### Hashes

*cyclonedx-gomod* uses the same hashing algorithm Go uses for its [module authentication](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/25530-sumdb.md#module-authentication-with).  
[`vikyd/go-checksum`](https://github.com/vikyd/go-checksum#calc-checksum-of-module-directory) does a great job of
explaining what exactly that entails. In essence, the hash you see in an SBOM should be the same as in your `go.sum` file,
just in a different format. This is because the CycloneDX specification enforces hashes to be provided in hex encoding,
while Go uses base64 encoded values.

### Version Detection

For the main module and local [replacement modules](https://golang.org/ref/mod#go-mod-file-replace), *cyclonedx-gomod* will perform version detection using Git:

* If the `HEAD` commit is tagged and the tag is a valid [semantic version](https://golang.org/ref/mod#versions), that tag is used.
* If `HEAD` is not tagged, a [pseudo version](https://golang.org/ref/mod#pseudo-versions) is generated.

> Please note that pseudo versions take the previous version into consideration.
> If your repository has been cloned with limited depth, *cyclonedx-gomod* may not be able to see any previous versions.
> For example, [actions/checkout@v2](https://github.com/actions/checkout/tree/v2.3.4#checkout-v2) clones repositories with `fetch-depth: 1` per default.

At the moment, no VCS other than Git is supported. If you need support for another VCS, please open an issue or submit a PR.

### Fixes

* Fix normalized versions interfering with hash calculation ([#58](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-gomod/issues/58) via [#60](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-gomod/pull/60))
* Fix `app` command missing dependencies when `main` package is spread across multiple files ([#75](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-gomod/issues/75) via [#78](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-gomod/pull/78))
  * Also addresses [#76](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-gomod/issues/76) (thanks [TheDiveO](https://github.com/TheDiveO) for reporting!) 

### Breaking Changes

* The CLI now consists of multiple subcommands, thus being incompatible with the CLI in cyclonedx-gomod `v0.x`
* Detected licenses (when using the `-licenses` flag) will now use the `components/evidence/licenses` node instead of `components/licenses`. Tools that consume SBOMs and don't support CycloneDX v1.3 yet may not recognize those licenses
* Version normalization has been removed ([#60](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-gomod/pull/60)). As a consequence, `+incompatible` suffixes and `v` prefixes (`-novprefix` flag in `v0.x`) are not trimmed anymore
* The `-reproducible` flag has been removed (via [`9b45f4a`](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-gomod/commit/9b45f4a0e905dc89bef1d238c28de908bd4163a0))

### Dependency Updates

* Update `github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-go` from `v0.3.0` to `v0.4.0` (via [`5bab19b`](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-gomod/commit/5bab19bbed9c6de22112ebeb2f71691c4b4163f5))
* Update `golang.org/x/mod` from `v0.4.2` to `v0.5.1` (via [#57](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-gomod/pull/57) and [`088f0e3`](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-gomod/commit/088f0e30e6aa80a37f767651877cf943563960a4))
* Update `golang.org/x/crypto` from `v0.0.0-20210711020723-a769d52b0f97` to `v0.0.0-20210817164053-32db794688a5` (via [`75ae52a`](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-gomod/commit/75ae52ac039d9d702a1861c9625d0a14116097ce))

### Building and Packaging

* Produce and publish an SBOM for each binary built when releasing (via [#62](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-gomod/pull/62))
* Builds for `windows/386` and `linux/386` have been dropped (via [#62](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-gomod/pull/62))
* Use standard Go notation for architectures in release artifact names (via [#62](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-gomod/pull/62))
  * e.g. `cyclonedx-gomod_1.0.0_windows_x64.zip` is now `cyclonedx-gomod_1.0.0_windows_amd64.zip`
